# SpeakingLua
###### A project to interpret a subset of Lua.  
Lua is dynamically typed and needs no explicit casts for type. Check the [Lua reference manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/) for details.  
The interfaces for our code and the meaning of each step can be found [here](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part7/). The given is part 7, the bare minimum to get started.

##### How to Use
Run test_semantiff.py
The code in code.txt is run and the variables are outputted at program end.

The given example is the sum of cubes from 0 to 10.
The output should be:
a: 10
b: 3025
(Not the exact format)

The code file may be changed to check various files
